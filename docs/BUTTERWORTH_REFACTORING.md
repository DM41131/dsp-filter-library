# Butterworth Filter Refactoring

## Overview

The Butterworth filter generation code has been refactored to improve code organization, maintainability, and reusability. The refactoring maintains backward compatibility while providing a cleaner, more modular architecture.

## Changes Made

### 1. Created `BaseIIRFilter` Class (`src/base-iir-filter.js`)

A new abstract base class that provides common functionality for all IIR filter types:

- **Common validation methods**: Parameter validation for all filter types
- **Shared utility methods**: Pole pairing, bilinear transformation, transfer function evaluation
- **Prototype building**: Common logic for building filters from normalized poles
- **Abstract methods**: Template for subclasses to implement specific pole calculations and design methods

### 2. Created `ButterworthFilter` Class (`src/butterworth-filter.js`)

A dedicated class specifically for Butterworth filter design:

- **Extends BaseIIRFilter**: Inherits common functionality
- **Butterworth-specific pole calculation**: `calculatePoles()` method
- **Specialized design methods**: Separate methods for lowpass/highpass vs bandpass/bandstop
- **Comprehensive error handling**: Detailed validation and error messages
- **Clean API**: Simple `design()` method that routes to appropriate implementation

### 3. Updated `IIRDesigner` Class (`src/iir.js`)

Modified the main IIR designer to use the new ButterworthFilter class:

- **Simplified butterworth method**: Now just delegates to ButterworthFilter.design()
- **Maintained backward compatibility**: Existing API unchanged
- **Cleaner code**: Removed duplicate Butterworth-specific logic

## Benefits of Refactoring

### 1. **Separation of Concerns**
- Butterworth-specific logic isolated in dedicated class
- Common IIR functionality shared through base class
- Clear responsibility boundaries

### 2. **Improved Maintainability**
- Easier to modify Butterworth-specific behavior
- Common functionality centralized and reusable
- Better code organization and structure

### 3. **Enhanced Reusability**
- BaseIIRFilter can be extended for other filter types (Chebyshev, Elliptic, etc.)
- ButterworthFilter can be used independently
- Common utilities available to all filter implementations

### 4. **Better Error Handling**
- Comprehensive parameter validation
- Clear, descriptive error messages
- Consistent error handling across all methods

### 5. **Backward Compatibility**
- Existing code continues to work unchanged
- No breaking changes to public API
- Gradual migration path available

## File Structure

```
src/
├── base-iir-filter.js      # Abstract base class for IIR filters
├── butterworth-filter.js   # Dedicated Butterworth filter implementation
├── iir.js                  # Updated main IIR designer (uses ButterworthFilter)
└── ... (other existing files)
```

## Usage Examples

### Direct ButterworthFilter Usage

```javascript
import { ButterworthFilter } from './src/butterworth-filter.js';

// Lowpass filter
const lpFilter = ButterworthFilter.design('lowpass', 100, 1000, 4);

// Highpass filter
const hpFilter = ButterworthFilter.design('highpass', 200, 1000, 4);

// Bandpass filter
const bpFilter = ButterworthFilter.design('bandpass', [150, 250], 1000, 4);
```

### Backward Compatible Usage

```javascript
import { IIRDesigner } from './src/iir.js';

// Still works exactly as before
const filter = IIRDesigner.butterworth('lowpass', 100, 1000, 4);
```

## Future Extensions

The refactored architecture makes it easy to add new filter types:

1. **Create new filter class** extending `BaseIIRFilter`
2. **Implement abstract methods** (`calculatePoles`, `design`)
3. **Add to IIRDesigner** if desired for backward compatibility

Example:
```javascript
export class ChebyshevFilter extends BaseIIRFilter {
  static calculatePoles(order, ripple) {
    // Chebyshev-specific pole calculation
  }
  
  static design(kind, cutoffHz, fs, order, ripple = 1) {
    // Chebyshev-specific design logic
  }
}
```

## Testing

The refactored code maintains the same mathematical behavior as the original implementation. All existing tests should continue to pass without modification.

## Migration Guide

### For New Code
- Use `ButterworthFilter.design()` directly for new implementations
- Consider using `BaseIIRFilter` for custom filter implementations

### For Existing Code
- No changes required - existing code continues to work
- Consider migrating to direct `ButterworthFilter` usage for better error handling

## Conclusion

This refactoring significantly improves the codebase structure while maintaining full backward compatibility. The new architecture is more maintainable, testable, and extensible, making it easier to add new filter types and modify existing behavior in the future.
